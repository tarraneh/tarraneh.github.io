We recenty submitted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02688">new paper</a> which compares the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04670">Reines et al. 2019</a> sample of compact radio sources in dwarf galaxies to the persistent radio source associated with the first repeating fast radio burst, FRB 121102. In the Reines et al. 2019 paper, the authors suggest that the radio sources cannot be explained by emission from HII regions, supernova remnants, or normal radio supernovae, and that instead, the emission is due to accreting black holes that have in some cases wandered from the centers of their host galaxies. In our new paper, we explore the alternative possibility that these radio sources are analogs of the FRB 121102 persistent radio source. We find a number of similarities, including the radio luminosities and spatial offsets, suggesting that both lasses of events may arise from the same population.
