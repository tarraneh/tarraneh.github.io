I"ª<p>Claude Shannonâ€™s information theory has long posited that an encrypted message is completely secure given that the decryption key is randomly generated, at least as long as the message itself, and discarded after only a single use. Quantum data locking is a new method of transferring encrypted data via quantum systems in which the key can be exponentially shorter than the message itself. Researchers at the University of Rochester have experimentally demonstrated this method for the first time.
