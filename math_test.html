<p><b>Equations of Stellar Structures</b></p>


<p>In solving the equations of stellar structure, we generally make several assumptions about the star, namely that it is  a spherical, non-relativistic, non-rotating body in both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium.</p>

<p>If we take the Sun as an example, hydrostatic equilibrium refers to the fact that the inward force of gravity is balanced by the outward force of pressure. More specifically, the gradient of pressure as a function of radius (with pressure decreasing outwards, with increasing radius) counteracts the force of gravity. In the absence of pressure support, the Sun would succumb to the forces of gravity and collapse via free-fall in a time $t_{\rm ff} \approx 1800$ s. This balance between pressure and gravity gives us the <i>Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium</i>: </p>
