                                <p>A few weeks ago, I attended the 35th Jerusalem Winter School in Theoretical Physics. This year's topic was Astronomical Transients. Over the next several weeks, I'll be writing up my lecture notes and posting them here. For those interested, you can also find the lectures themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsSmwFZGvm-skJeCPCCZvIjS" target="new">here</a>.</p><br>




<p><b>Stellar Evolution and Stellar Endpoints</b><br>
<i>Lecture by E. Sterl Phinney</i></p>


<p><b>Equations of Stellar Structures</b></p>


<p>In solving the equations of stellar structure, we generally make several assumptions about the star, namely that it is  a spherical, non-relativistic, non-rotating body in both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium.</p>

<p>If we take the Sun as an example, hydrostatic equilibrium refers to the fact that the inward force of gravity is balanced by the outward force of pressure. More specifically, the gradient of pressure as a function of radius (with pressure decreasing outwards, with increasing radius) counteracts the force of gravity. In the absence of pressure support, the Sun would succumb to the forces of gravity and collapse via free-fall in a time \(t_{\rm ff} \approx 1800\) s. This balance between pressure and gravity gives us the <i>Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium</i>: </p>


<p>$$\dfrac{dP(r)}{dr} = -\dfrac{-GM(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}$$</p>

<p>The next equation of stellar structure describes the mass as a function of radius and is referred to as the <i>Equation of Mass Conservation</i> or the <i>Equation of Mass Continuity</i>: </p>


<p>$$\dfrac{dM}{dr} = 4 \pi r^2\rho(r)$$</p>

<p>Similarly, the <i>Equation of Energy Conservation</i> states that the rate of energy generation sets the luminosity gradient as a function of radius. 
</p>

<p>$$\dfrac{dL(r)}{dr} = 4 \pi r^2\rho(r) \epsilon(r)$$</p>

<p>where (\epsilon(r) \) is the energy produced per unit mass.</p>

<p>The final equation of stellar structure is the <i>Equation of Radiative Energy Transport</i> or the <i>Temperature Gradient Equation</i>, and is given by:
</p>

<p>$$\dfrac{dT(r)}{dr} = -\dfrac{3\kappa \rho L}{4 a c T^3 r \pi r^2}$$</p>

<p>where \(kappa \approx \kappa_{es} + K\rho T^{-7/2}\) is the opacity and is a function of the density, temperature, and chemical composition at a given radius of the star. For low densities and high temperatures, the opacity is due to electron scattering (i.e. the relevant cross-section is the Thomson cross-section). At intermediate temperatures and densities, the opacity is governed by Kramer's Law, in which bound-free and free-free transitions determine the opacity. At low temperatures, the picture becomes more complicated, as individual molecules will recombine and dust will begin to form. </p>


<p>The (non-degenerate) equation of state for a star given by:</p>

<p>$$P_{nd} = \dfrac{\rho k T}{\mu} + \dfrac{1}{3}a T^4$$</p>

<p>Here, the first term refers to the equation of state for an ideal gas, and the second term defines the radiation pressure. In cases where degeneracy pressure applies (i.e. in white dwarfs or neutron stars), the equation of state is modified with an additional term due to degeneracy pressure which scales as \(P_{\rm deg} \propto \rho^{5/3}\).</p>

<p>We also note that although these equations assume radiative equilibrium, there are certain stages during stellar evolution when it does not apply. For example, as the stellar core contracts between burning phases, gravitational binding energy is released. In these cases, time-dependent equations must be used. </p>
