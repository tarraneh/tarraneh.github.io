## About
I am a graduate student at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. My research focuses on transient phenomena, including tidal disruption events and fast radio bursts. 
## Features

In the past, I've worked as part of the [Long Wavelength Array](http://www.phys.unm.edu/~lwa/index.html) collaboration based out of the University of New Mexico.

Though I'm east-coast bound for the time being, I'm a desert dweller at heart, hailing from the enchanted mountains of Northern New Mexico.
