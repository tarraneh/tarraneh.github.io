## About

<img src="images/profilepic.jpg" align="left" width="38%" style="display:inline;margin:4px 4px 4px 2px;"> I am a CIERA Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University and a member of the [Fast and Fortunate for FRB Follow-up (F4)](https://sites.google.com/ucolick.org/f-4) collaboration. My research focuses on time-domain astronomy, from tidal disruption events to fast radio bursts and superluminous supernovae, with a particular emphasis on the radio properties these events. In the past, I worked as part of the [Long Wavelength Array](http://www.phys.unm.edu/~lwa/index.html) collaboration based out of the University of New Mexico.

In my time off, I enjoy playing piano, strength training, and carpentry. Though I am Chicago-bound for the time being, I'm a desert dweller at heart, hailing from the enchanted mountains of Northern New Mexico.
